`{xengagement}` is a package that predicts the amount of Twitter
engagement that [xGPhilosophy](https://twitter.com/xGPhilosophy)
receives with its end-of-match xG summary tweets. The predictions are
shared with automated tweets made by [a
bot](https://twitter.com/punditratio), occasionally including some
manually inserted commentary :grinning:.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{xengagement}` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('tonyelhabr/xengagement')
```
